# The Movie Network

The Movie Network is social platform for movie buffs. We built this as a final project for the Web Development course (CS5610) at Northeastern University. This project is built on top of the MERN Stack using React and Redux for the front-end and Node.js for the backend. You can view the published webapp at: https://themovienetwork.herokuapp.com
